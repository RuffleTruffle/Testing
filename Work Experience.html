One of the techniques I have used is end-to-end testing (E2E testing), which tests the entire functionality of the application from the user’s perspective. I have used Cypress, a JavaScript-based framework that enables fast and reliable automation of web applications. I have also used Cypress’s test management features, such as organizing tests into suites, running tests in parallel, and generating reports.</p></td>
